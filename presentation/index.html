                <p>
                    The United States is home to some of the most unique and stunning natural geographical features in
                    the world. Over the course of nearly 200 years, 62 of these sites have been designated as National
                    Parks. Every year, these parks support as many as 90 million visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2020 has been a challenging year for many people. The COVID-19 pandemic has altered daily life in
                    many ways and has made it difficult for to engage in many recreational activities. One thing that
                    has remained consistent throughout this time is that open outdoor spaces offer a safer alternative
                    to indoor activities, while promoting physical activity. Fortunately, the United States is home to
                    an incredibly varied and and beautiful landscape. This is made even more accessible by the National
                    Parks System.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our project begins with an exploration of the effect that the pandemic has had on visitations to the
                    National Parks, and follows this with a general exploration of the history and location of National
                    Parks throughout the country.

                <p class="vis__description">
                    There has been a marked decline in visitors to the National Parks during the ongoing pandemic. This
                    decline is most visible during April 2020 when many states first enacted precautionary social
                    distancing legislation. Although outdoor activities are recommended as some of the safest
                    recreational options, park utilization remained lower than 2019 for the rest of 2020.

                        Yellowstone National Park, spanning across three contiguous states&mdash;Montana, Idaho, and
                        Wyoming, was officially established as the first National Park in 1872. Some thirty years later,
                        President Theodore Roosevelt passed the Antiquities Act of 1906, creating presidential authority
                        to designate historic landmarks on federal lands as national monuments. The act served as a
                        precursor to the designation of many National Parks. Over the next century, around 60 national
                        parks have been founded. The most recent ones are&mdash;Indiana Dunes, Indiana and White Sands,
                        New Mexico&mdash;founded last year.

                        Most National Parks are located in the West, some in Midwest and South. In this visualization of
                        the United States, each hexagon represents a National Park in that region. Some parks are shared
                        among multiple states and hence they are represented by half hexagons in those states. While a
                        native Bostonian is bereft of access to most National Parks, if you want to visit many of them,
                        you might want to take a flight to Denver, Colorado and then drive around the natural beauties.

                            The National Parks offer over 100 different activities. They can be broadly categorized into
                            six categories. In the radar chart below, categories are shown in six axes while each area
                            represents a park. The greater is an area's intersection along a category axis, the greater
                            is the number of activities of that category available at that park. The specific parks
                            displayed are determined by your selected preferences regarding activities and region.
